# Apache Superset Data Analysis Project

This project involves using Apache Superset to analyze a provided dataset, create charts, and build dashboards. The tasks include visualizing user
messages by channel and analyzing non-archived channels with no recent comments.

## Installation

To install Apache Superset and its prerequisites, follow the instructions in
the [official documentation](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/installing-superset-using-docker-compose).

## Task 1: Visualizing User Messages by Channel

To complete this task:

- Create a pie chart showing the number of messages written by users for each channel.
- Save the chart and add it to a dashboard.
- Enable filtering options for channels, users, and message timestamps.
- Save the dashboard.

## Task 2: Analyzing Non-Archived Channels

To complete this task:

- Retrieve non-archived channels without recent comments.
- Gather the last message's user and timestamp for each qualifying channel.
- Create a line chart showing the number of comments per user.
- Create a table displaying channel names, the last message's user, and message timestamps.
- Save both charts in a dashboard.
- Enable filtering options for users.

## Conclusion

This project involved installing Apache Superset, understanding how superset works, finding ways to aggregate data on datasets or create new ones and 
creating interactive dashboards.
